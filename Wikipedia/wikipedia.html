            <p>Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Patna in the state of Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh.[3][10][11] His father is a retired technical officer and worked at Bihar State Handloom Corporation in Patna, and his mother was a homemaker.[12] Rajput was the only son and the youngest of five siblings and had the nickname Gulshan.[13] One of his four sisters, Mitu Singh, was a state-level cricket player.[10] He studied at St. Karen's High School in Patna.[13][14] His family moved to Delhi following his mother's death in 2002 where he completed his schooling for intermediate studies in the Kulachi Hansraj Model School.[11]</p>
<p>Rajput was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in astrophysics and won the National Olympiad in Physics.[15] He secured admission in the Delhi College of Engineering (later renamed Delhi Technological University) to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering.[16][15] According to Rajput, he did not have any interest in engineering but his family gave him no option which left him dissatisfied.
